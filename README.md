# Maze Exploration Simulator
A simple maze exploration simulator that uses raytracing techniques to create 3D-like effects in a C++ console terminal without using a game engine.

## Table of Contents

## Features
Console-Based Rendering: Uses text-based characters to simulate a 3D environment.

Raytracing Techniques: Implements basic raytracing principles to render maze walls and create a depth effect.

Keyboard Navigation: Move around the maze using WASD keys.

No External Game Engine: Built entirely with vanilla C++ in Visual Studio.

## Usage
Movement: Use the WASD keys to move through the maze.

Objective: Navigate the maze while enjoying the pseudo-3D raytracing effects rendered in the console.

## How It Works
Raytracing in Console: The project simulates raytracing by calculating distances to walls and rendering characters based on those distances, creating a 3D perspective effect in a text-based terminal.

Input Handling: The program captures keyboard input to update the player's position in the maze, refreshing the display accordingly.
